              <h1>Overview of french population</h1>
              <br>
              <br>
              Before going into detail of the inequalities across french population, we want to have an initial assessment of the situation.
              <br>
              To do so we are going to focus on four indicators:
              <ul>
                <li> <b>Body Mass Index</b> which put in relation weight and height in order to determine whether the person suffers from underweight or overweight.</li>
				<li> <b>Energy intakes</b>, the main sources of energy are fats and carbohydrates. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommandations, there is an optimal balance between those two sources. It corresponds approximately to 20-35% of fats and 45-60% of carbohydrates (for an adult).</li>
                <li> <b>Salt intakes</b>, even if salt is necessary for human body, its over-consumption is a major cause of cardiovascular diseases.</li>
				<li> <b>Fiber intakes</b>, fibers are the portion of plant-derived food that cannot be completely digested. They are necessary to ensure good digestion.</li>
			  </ul>
              <br>
              In all our study, we focus on adults only because child nutrition is a subject in itself and it is quite difficult to compare children nutritional intakes or weight with adults ones.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h3>Body Mass Index</h3>
              <br>
              BMI (Body Mass Index) is an indicator frequently used to put in relation the weight and the height of an individual. BMI gives a value that allow to classify people in categories:
              <ul>
                <li> Very) Severely underweight: less than 16</li>
                <li> Underweight: 16-18.5</li>
                <li> Normal (healthy weight): 18.5-25</li>
                <li> Overweight: 25-30</li>
                <li> Obese Class I (Moderately obese): 30-35</li>
                <li> Obese Class II (Severely obese): 35-40</li>
                <li> Obese Class III-VI (Very severely obese-Hyper Obese): more than 40</li>
              </ul>
              <i>(source Wikipedia)</i>
              <br>
              <br>
              The categories given above correspond to adults, because the expected BMI of children varies with age.  Even if this indicator is not perfect (for instance profession athletes use to have a high BMI, synonymous of overweight, whereas they are in very good physical health), it is an easy tool that can allow us to identify some trends in the population.
              <br>
              On the graph below we have chosen to put in blue underweight people, in green the ones that have a helthy weight, and in a range from orange to red people that are overweight to obese.
              <div class="col-md-13">
                <iframe class="boxplots" src="../visualisations/overview_bmi.html" frameBorder="0"></iframe> 
              </div>
              We can see that more than a third of the french population is overweight. We will see in more detail later how it affects different social background.
			  <br>
			  <h3>Energy uptake</h3>
			  The two graphs below show the intakes of carbohydrates and fats for different social groups, with the refence values corresponding to the optimal balance evoked earlier. It appears clearly that whithout distinction of social class, the typical diet the French population is too rich in fats and too poor in carbohydrates. It may look surprising given that nowadays the media often remind us about our general addiction to sugar, which is indeed a fact and the cause of a lot of sanitary issues. In fact people tend to consume too much fast sugars in particular. A more precise categorisation of the carbohydrates would allow to quantify this imbalance in the carbohydrates intake.

                <iframe class="boxplots" src="../visualisations/fat.png" frameBorder="0"></iframe> 
              </div>
			  <h3>Salt</h3>
			  Over-consumption of salt is also an old habit difficult to change for the French. The graph below showing the sodium intake indicates that this is also a problem affecting all social groups.
			  <div class="col-md-13">
                <iframe class="boxplots" src="../visualisations/sodium.png" frameBorder="0"></iframe> 
              </div>
              <h3>Fibers</h3>
			  Fibers are well-known from the public because of the constant reminders that "they are important for digestion", but their exact role is less famous. In fact they are a crucial regulator of the other nutrients intakes, retaining excessive cholesterol and modifying the absorbtion rate of some carbohydrates. A carency of fibers could be a factor for digestive troubles, but also cardiovascular diseases and colorectal cancers. Nevertheless the plot below shows that this carency is shared by the whole French population.
