# Abstract
(A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?)
## To change
We use a dataset available at https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnees-de-consommations-et-habitudes-alimentaires-de-letude-inca-2-3/?fbclid=IwAR0QcjTQdH2N2xIXL_xTLHuUIx5YFVWKNOJ4PqetIzeLoq5HNbnSTTre_d8 . This dataset contains many information about consumptions habits of the test subjects. We may also use OpenFoodFacts data base. Our goal is to analyze consumers eating habits and try to evaluate the impact of advertising on the habits of the consumers

# Research questions
(A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. )
## To change
How is impacted a consumer habits based on the advertising?

# Dataset
(List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.)

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
(Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.)
## To change 
<ul>
<li>We need to explore the datasets in order to find what exactly is contained in them. Eventually, we can find some more questions to ask them.</li>
<li>We aim at creating a PHP and JavaScript Web site enabling us to interact actively with the data (to create interactive charts, and have better comprehension of the data).</li>
</ul>

# Questions for TAa
(Add here some questions you have for us, in general or project-specific.)
## To change
Is there a possibility to keep data in memory cache with javascript, without reloading the whole datasets every time we have some minor modifications to do with the code?
