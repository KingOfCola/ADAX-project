          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Who has access to healthy food in France nowadays?</h2>
          <br>
          <br>
          The aim of our work is to answer this question through cross analysis of the Open Food Database and of an ANSES study 
          covering the food habits of 4000 people over a week. Indeed when talking about social inequalities in developed countries
          we think of housing, access to healthcare facilities or salaries but we use to ignore food, as famine seems to be a problem of the past
          in most of the occidental countries. 
          <br>
          <br>
          However, nowadays we are facing an increase of non-transmissible diseases. Among them obesity and Type II diabete are directly
          linked to nutrition and food habits. In some occidental countries, food issue has been entirely reversed since people don't die from under-nutrition nowadays, but rather from over-nutrition or at least malnutrition. Such food-related diseases have now become some of the most lethal diseases in those countries. For this reason, they represent a high cost for social security systems (in particular in France), for society and for individuals, and negatively impact people's lives. 
          <br>
		  Even beyond the health-related considerations, food is more than ever a social issue nowadays in France. The social movement of the "Gilets jaunes" proved it again recently: a huge part of demonstrators claim that it has become difficult to eat properly every day for them. Are these food inequalities inevitable, or could they be reduced through better information and organization ?
		  <br>
          <br>
          By looking at social markers, like age or diploma, as well as food products characteristics, we will try to study these inequalities.
